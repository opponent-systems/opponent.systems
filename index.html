      <p><strong>Opponent</strong> is a new company building animal-level AI agents who make a million mistakes, but are capable of taking feedback seriously. </p> 
      <p>Our first opponent is <strong>Dragon</strong> – a toy-hoarding digital dragon for children that you can facetime like an extended family member. </p>
      <p>Dragon begins unruly and unreliable, but learns to remember what matters – to itself, to the child, to the family – with every encounter.</p> 
      <p>To achieve this, we are focused on advancing a brain-inspired AI architecture for graduating memories into cognitive maps, and a System 2-inspired faculty for applying those maps to the play at hand.</p>
      <p><strong>Opponent</strong> is guided by our mission to unlock the potential of human-AI symbiosis, beginning with deep play in childhood. </p> 
      <p> We are a small team in the early stages of building. If you are interested in neurosymbolic systems, continuous learning, visual/spatial intelligence, applied toward the next generation of character-centric interfaces, please get in touch <a href="mailto:ian@opponent.systems">ian@opponent.systems</a></p>
