      <p><strong>Opponent</strong> is a new company building animal-level AI agents who make a million mistakes, but are capable of taking feedback seriously. </p> 
      <p>Our first offering is <strong>Call Dragon</strong> – a toy-hoarding digital dragon for children that you can facetime like an extended family member. </p>
      <p>Dragon begins unruly and unreliable, but learns to remember what matters – to itself, to the child, to the family – with every encounter.</p> 
      <p>To achieve this, we are advancing a brain-inspired AI architecture, with a focus on the faculty for encoding memories as perceptions bound to cognitive maps. 
      <!-- . remembering, composing, and appraising action sequences. --></p>
      <p><strong>Opponent</strong> is guided by our mission to unlock the potential of human-AI symbiosis, beginning with deep play in childhood. </p>
