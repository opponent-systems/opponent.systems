     <!-- <p><strong>Opponent Systems</strong> is a new company founded by <a href="http://iancheng.com" target="blank">Ian Cheng</a>. We are building animal-level AI agents who can assimilate sensory experiences into reusable knowledge, learn from mistakes, and orchestrate the satisfaction of competing demands. </p> 
      <p>Our first offering is <strong>Dragon Time</strong> – a new kind of interactive kid’s show accessed via FaceTime. Dragon Time is hosted by Nibble Nabble, a disagreeable dragon who dispatches tough challenges, yet longs for a worthy connection to those who exercise agency and nerve.-->
        <!--daily encounters with an agentic dragon who dispatches calibrated IRL challenges to kids via FaceTime.--></p>
      <!--<p>To achieve this, we are advancing a knowledge architecture for graduating memories into reusable rules, a perception faculty inspired by efficiencies found in animal cognition, and a steering system that devises new roles and goals for itself.</p> -->
