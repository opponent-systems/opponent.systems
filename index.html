      <p><strong>Opponent</strong> is a new company building animal-level AI agents who make a million mistakes, but are capable assimilating knowledge in real-time and taking feedback seriously. </p> 
      <p>Our first offering is <strong>Dragon Time</strong> – daily encounters with a digital dragon who dispatches personalized challenges to kids via FaceTime.</p>
      <p>To achieve this, we are advancing a brain-inspired AI architecture for graduating memories into cognitive maps, and a System 2-inspired faculty for applying those maps to the play at hand.</p>
      <p>We are guided by our mission to exercise agency in kids (and their parents) as they navigate the grand and personal tribulations of the decade to come. </p> 
      <p> We are a small team, obsessed with integrating engineering and the arts for the next generation. If you are interested in neurosymbolic systems, continuous learning, visual/spatial intelligence, applied toward the next generation of character-centric interfaces, please get in touch: <a href="mailto:ian@opponent.systems">ian@opponent.systems</a></p>
